# FitGo

FitGo is a desktop application made for personal trainers and clients to be able to more easily connect with one another. It features a map that allows clients to view personal trainers in their area, with the ability to filter specific skills that they're looking for in a trainer. The client can also adjust the distance/radius that they are searching from based on their current location, and "favorite" certain trainers to be saved in a convenient list for later reference. Clients and trainers also have their own profiles listing further details about what skills and certification they have.
